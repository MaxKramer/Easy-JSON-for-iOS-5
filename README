Easy-JSON for iOS 5.

This helper class allows you to easily make use of the JSON functions found in the iOS 5 SDK, by adding a JSONValue category to NSString and NSData. 

This is a substitute for using SBJSON and JSONKit and uses NSJSONSerialization.

There shouldn't be any problems, but if there are, please open an issue at the top!
